Unity Kata #10 - Fighting Game

What is a fighting game?
 - two player game
 - players control some character
 - gameplay: fight against each other
 - fight = 3 systems: attack, defend, grab (like rock paper scissors, really)
 - each fight mechanic is triggered by input
 - players have health also, first to hit 0 loses.

Current features:
 * makeshift characters with basic animations

ToDo:
- set feet to ground 0, not torso (at least fix anims)
- fix P1 mirror issue
- implement grab system
- improve attack and defend systems
